At the Artifactory, we believe that laser cutting should be accessible for everyone. Our machines allows artists, designers, makers, and hobbyists to take their ideas from concept to physical object. 

## Material types

* **Acrylics**: Acrylic is one of the best materials for laser cutting — offering a smooth, clean finish.
* **Wood**: We can laser cut many types of wood, such as plywood, MDF, veneer, and solid woods, each offering a unique finish due to its grain and natural imperfections.
* **Paper and Card Stock**: Perfect for invitation cards, architectural models, and crafts.
* **Fabric**: Our lasers can cut through natural fibre fabric cleanly and without fraying.
* **Anodized Aluminum**: Our lasers can etch designs onto anodized aluminum — great for creating labels, badges, and more. This includes personalised water bottles.
- **Leather**: Our lasers can cut and engrave vegetable tanned leather. Leather's a popular material for custom projects like footwear, fashion accessories, and more.
- **Glass**: While we can't cut glass, our laser cutters can etch designs onto its surface.

For a comprehensive list and for specifics on any material not mentioned here, please feel free to get in touch with us. Each project is unique, and we're here to ensure you get the best result with your chosen material.

Please note that certain materials, often due to toxic fume production, are unsuitable or unsafe for laser cutting, such as PVC, polycarbonate, chrome-tanned leather, and metals not mentioned above.

## Things you can make

Are you new to laser cutting, or just looking for inspiration for your next project? We've seen a vast array of wonderful creations brought to life with our machines. The possibilities really are endless, limited only by your imagination. To get your creative juices flowing, here are some examples of what you can make with laser cutting:

1. **Personalised jewellery**: Create custom pendants, earrings, rings, or brooches from acrylics, wood, or metal.
2. **Architectural models**: Perfect for making precise and detailed scale models for architectural or engineering projects.
3. **Signage**: Custom signage for businesses, personal use, or events can be created in a number of materials for a unique and professional touch.
4. **Home decor**: From wall art to intricate lampshades, coasters, and more, laser cutting can help in elevating any space.
5. **Crafts and toys**: Make puzzle pieces, model kits or custom toys with precision and ease.
6. **Personal accessories**: Personalise phone cases, wallets, or keychains to stand out.
7. **Art installations**: Laser cutting allows artists to create intricate designs for sculptural or decorative pieces.
8. **Identity Engraving**: Protect your valuables by engraving your name or a unique identifier onto them. Ideal for security, it's a popular choice for personal belongings such as laptops, audio equipment, musical instruments, tools, and more. An engraved item is less likely to be stolen and easier to recover if lost.
9. **Fashion and Apparel**: Design unique patterns for fabric, leather accessories, or embellishments.
10. **Prototypes**: For inventors or businesses, laser cutting is often the fastest and most cost-effective way to create prototypes of a new product or part.
11. **Jigs, fixtures, and templates**: It's easy to laser-cut precise patterns and shapes to help with woodworking and metalworking tasks.
12. **Storage and display**: Make eye-catching display stands or snug storage solutions for your collectables - with custom designs, it's easy to get the exact dimensions you need.

Remember, with laser cutting, the only limit is your imagination. If you have an idea outside of these examples or need help bringing a unique vision to life, we're here to help!

## Training provided

Regardless of your experience level, we're here to help you make the most of our laser cutting services. If you're doing a one-off project, we recommend having our expert team handle your laser cutting needs. Our trained operators will help ensure your design is executed flawlessly, maintaining the highest level of safety and precision.

However, if you wish to make laser cutting a regular facet of your creativity or work, we encourage you to join one of our hands-on training courses.

Our training covers:
* Safety procedures and guidelines
* Understanding laser cutter components
* Preparing your designs for laser cutting
* Operating the laser cutter and handling materials

Upon completion of the training, you'll have the confidence and knowledge to create your projects with our laser cutters during your Artifactory visits.
