We are a non profit group run entirely by volunteers and supported by people like you. If you believe in what we're doing or we've helped you here are some ways you can support us.

## Help us spread the word

### Tell your friends

Do you know of a group or community that could thrive at the Artifactory? Let them know!

### Bring someone to the space

There's no better way to support our community than by helping it grow. Our [First Visit](https://artifactory.org.au/first_visit) guide has some resources that your guest may find useful.

### Leave a review

After you've used our workshop please leave a review on [Google](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hU6H6zJKj8GiJVr39) and/or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/perthartifactory), it's a great way to show others that you've enjoyed your time at our workshop.

## Doantions

The Artifactory survives and thrives through the support of people like you.

### Donate equipment or consumables

The facilities we offer to the community are only possible because of the equipment and consumables (wood, masking tape, fixings, electronic components, etc) donated by our supporters. We are also set up to distribute donated equipment to worthy causes when we are unable to use the item directly. 

Please [contact us](https://artifactory.org.au/about#contact) first before bringing in equipment or consumables. We will also be able to advise whether the donation is [tax deductible](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/donating).

### Donate eligible drink containers

We are registered with the [Containers for Change](https://www.containersforchange.com.au/wa/) scheme and containers can be donated to us in two ways:

* If you're already dropping in for an event let one of our volunteers know and we can process the donation directly (We are unable to provide a receipt for containers donated on site)
* You can take containers to any [donation point](https://www.containersforchange.com.au/wa/return-locations) and quote our scheme ID `C10494301`. Donations made to a listed collection point in our name are [tax deductible](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/donating)

### Donate funds directly

Direct monetary donations can be sent to the following account:

Name: `Perth Artifactory Inc`
BSB: `086 366`
Account: `329 833 366`

Donations over $2 sent to this account are [tax deductible](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/donating). Please [Contact us](mailto:treasurer@artifactory.org.au) for a receipt if you're not an existing member.

### Wills and estates

By making a bequest to us you are directly supporting a diverse community of makers, artists, and creatives. Your generosity ensures equal opportunities for all, regardless of background or experience, to learn, make, and share within our cooperative environment. Please [contact us](https://artifactory.org.au/about#contact) for more details.
