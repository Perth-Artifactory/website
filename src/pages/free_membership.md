## Tertiary Students

Thanks to some of our generous donors the Artifactory has an opportunity to provide several fixed length free memberships for tertiary students. This opportunity is open to tertiary students who are interested in design, artistic creativity, engineering, cosplay, music, electronics and who just want to make stuff.  Members of the Artifactory will also support the successful applicants in the areas of their interests.

Applications are processed on a rolling basis. We endeavour to process all applicants within 14 days.

PLEASE NOTE: This membership type is subject to the continued support of our donors. If you would like to support us in this endeavour please [get in touch](mailto:treasurer@artifactory.org.au "Email the Treasurer").

### Application Process

Interested applicants should [submit](mailto:apply@artifactory.org.au) a 1 page application addressing the following points:

* What opportunities does the Perth Artifactory offer you?
* What equipment can you see yourself using as part of your membership and for what?
* What sort of assistance do you think you will need from the existing Artifactory Members for your projects?
* Do you belong to any other Hacker/Maker spaces? If so, which?
* What campus will you attend in 2023?

# Resident Artists

## NoizeMaschin!!

The Perth Artifactory facilitates a rotating artist residency, where the artist in residence performs at the inhouse monthly experimental music night â€“ NoizeMaschin!!

Over a 3-6 month period, the successful applicant receives:

* 24 hour access to the Artifactory.
* Support and training on the usage of Artifactory equipment and resources.
* Free entry to Artifactory workshops and events.
* 3 consecutive 10 minute performance slots at NoizeMaschin!! Perth.

### Application Process

While this residency is funded by the Artifactory the selection process is administered by NoizeMaschin!! directly.

We are looking for applicants that will make good use of our tools and facilities to develop their performance, artistic, and community endeavours. It is ideal if we can see a plan or trajectory of development over the course of the membership. Above all we like to see a spark of creativity and passion for what you do.

The following questions are to help guide your proposal, and are optional

* Give a brief rundown of how your residency performances will play out. We are looking for a sense of artistic development over the course of the 3 performances.
* What Artifactory equipment can you see yourself using as part of your performance development?
* Is there any community engagement aspect to your residency i.e., reaching out to people from diverse backgrounds.
* Are there any workshops/events either currently being held at the space, or in development, that you would like to attend or help facilitate?
* How will this residency benefit your artistic practice upon completion?
* Any significant performance/installation/research experience?

Completed applications should be [submitted](mailto:noizemaschinperth@gmail.com) by the middle of January, April, July, or October to be eligible for consideration for the next available residency.
