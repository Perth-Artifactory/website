## Tertiary Students

Thanks to some of our generous donors the Artifactory has an opportunity to provide several fixed length free memberships for tertiary students. This opportunity is open to tertiary students who are interested in design, artistic creativity, engineering, cosplay, music, electronics and who just want to make stuff.  Members of the Artifactory will also support the successful applicants in the areas of their interests.

Applications are processed on a rolling basis. We endeavour to process all applicants within 14 days.

PLEASE NOTE: This membership type is subject to the continued support of our donors. If you would like to support us in this endeavour please [get in touch](mailto:treasurer@artifactory.org.au "Email the Treasurer").

### Application Process

Interested applicants should [submit](mailto:apply@artifactory.org.au) a 1 page application addressing the following points:

* What opportunities does the Perth Artifactory offer you?
* What equipment can you see yourself using as part of your membership and for what?
* What sort of assistance do you think you will need from the existing Artifactory Members for your projects?
* Do you belong to any other Hacker/Maker spaces? If so, which?
* What campus will you attend in 2025?
* Are there any workshops/events being held at the Artifactory that you would like to attend or help facilitate?
* Could you see yourself running any sort of workshop in the future at the Artifactory? If so what?

### Notes

* This opportunity is not open to current or past members of Perth Artifactory Inc.
* You must be a tertiary student for 2025 and be at least 18 years of age.
* 24/7 access to the workshop can be granted with this membership but it requires a key bond of $135 to be paid. The bond is refundable at the end of your membership or can be carried over if you wish to extend your membership after the sponsorship period. You will need to meet several suitability requirements to get a key.
* The Perth Artifactory Committee reserves the right to cancel your membership at any time.
* This membership is an Associate Membership under our constitution and has no voting rights.
* Tool usage fees are payable on some Artifactory tools in line with the fees charged to Concession members.
* This membership does not give free access to our rehearsal space but does allow the holder to access a discounted usage rate.
