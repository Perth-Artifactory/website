          <strong className="text-highlight-1">The Perth Artifactory</strong> is the Hackerspace/Makerspace in Perth,
          Western Australia. We currently occupy a large warehouse unit in Osborne Park and which is populated with
          tools, technology, desks and workstations.
          <br />
          <br />
          Essentially we are a communal workshop where members who join get access to the tools and machinery in the
          space to make anything that they want.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are run by volunteers (members) and currently have over 65 financial members and hundreds of regular
          visitors for our workshops and events.
