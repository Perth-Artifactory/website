# Membership

The Artifactory is mainly funded by its memberships and all funds received go towards keeping the Artifactory doors open. We do not receive ongoing government funding and pay rent at commercial rates.

In the interest of supporting the local community we also have several [free membership programs](/pages/freeMembership).

Joining the Artifactory as a member (as opposed to using the space casually) requires an application to join. We encourage everyone to tour the space in person at one of our Open Days first before applying to join as a member. Once you have submitted your application and paid the corresponding membership fee you're able to use the space as a member until your application is processed. The only exception is you will need to be approved before you can get a 24/7 key. In the event your application is unsuccessful (rare) we will refund your membership fee.
